# Soroti Tech Outreach Program

The Tek Talent Africa team recently conducted a successful tech outreach program in Soroti, Eastern Uganda. This initiative aims to introduce programming and technology skills to students in regions with limited access to tech education.

## Program Overview

During our two-day program, we worked closely with 85 secondary school students, introducing them to:

1. **Basic Programming Concepts** - Using Python to teach foundational programming logic
2. **Web Development Fundamentals** - Introduction to HTML and CSS
3. **Technology Career Pathways** - Guidance on pursuing careers in technology

## Impact and Outcomes

The program had several significant outcomes:

- Students created their first web pages and simple Python programs
- Five student projects were selected for further development and mentorship
- The school established a continuing Computer Club with our support
- Local teachers received training to continue supporting students' tech education

## Student Testimonials

> "I never thought I could create something on a computer myself. Now I know I can become a programmer!" - Sarah, S4 Student

> "The mentors were patient and explained things in a way that made sense. I'm excited to continue learning programming." - John, S5 Student

## Local Support

We extend our gratitude to the Soroti Secondary School administration, the District Education Office, and our local partners who made this outreach possible.

## Sustainability Plan

To ensure the impact continues beyond our visit:

1. We've donated laptops and learning resources to the school
2. Established a virtual mentorship program connecting students with tech professionals
3. Provided a structured curriculum for the Computer Club
4. Set up a WhatsApp support group for ongoing guidance

## Future Plans

Based on the success of this program, we plan to expand our outreach to more schools in Eastern Uganda, with the goal of reaching at least 5 additional schools by the end of the year.
