## Overview
Our blog system is built using a static markdown-based approach, which provides several benefits including:
- Fast loading times
- Easy content management
- Version control friendly
- SEO optimized

## Content Structure
Each blog post consists of two main parts:
1. Frontmatter (Metadata)
2. Content (Markdown)

### Frontmatter
The frontmatter contains essential metadata about the blog post:
- title: The main title of the post
- date: Publication date
- description: A brief summary of the post
- author: The writer's name
- image: Path to the featured image
- category: Post categorization
- slug: URL-friendly identifier

### Content
The main content is written in Markdown format, which supports:
- Headers
- Lists
- Links
- Images
- Code blocks
- And more...

## Technical Implementation
The system uses:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Gray-matter for parsing markdown files
- Static file generation for optimal performance

## How to Create a New Post
1. Create a new markdown file
2. Add frontmatter with required metadata
3. Write content in markdown format
4. Save the file in the appropriate directory
